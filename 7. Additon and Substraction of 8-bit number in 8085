For addition: 
LDA 3000H : Load 1st operand into accumulator (A)
MOV B, A: Copy A into B 
LDA 3001 H : Load 2nd operand into accumulator (A)
ADD B : Add B into A -> result in A
STA 3002H : Store result from A into 3002 H
HLT

For substration 
LDA 4000H : Load 1st number into A
MOV B, A: Copy A into B
LDA 4001H : Load 2nd no into B
SUB B : Subtract B from A result in A
STA 4002H : Store result into 4002H
HLT
